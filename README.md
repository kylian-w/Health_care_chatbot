# Health_care_chatbot
This is a personal project undertaken with a fellow classmate. The objective is to create a healthcare chatbot. The chatbot is given symptoms of a disease by the user
and it eventually makes a diagnosis of what the disease can be, with some degree  of certainty. The chatbot eventually gives some precautions to take in order to avoid this specific
disease, as well as some additional information about the disease for example, the possible origins of the disease, in which geographical areas the disease is concurrently breaking out etc.
